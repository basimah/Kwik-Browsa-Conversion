Here are the files needed to build the project.
The build directory contains two jar files, to execute the browser launch browser.jar

You should be able to import the project into an eclipse project too.
All libraries required are in the lib folder.

To build the browser run build.xml as an ant build (eclipse can do this really easily 
you just open up the file and click the "Play" button).

In Eclipse you just need to import an existing project.

If there are any more questions or problems just ask and hopefully I can help.
